`Arriba <https://github.com/suhrig/arriba>`_ is a command-line tool for the detection of gene fusions from RNA-Seq data.
It was developed for the use in a clinical research setting.
Therefore, short runtimes and high sensitivity were important design criteria.
It is based on the ultrafast STAR aligner, and the post-alignment runtime is typically just ~2 minutes.
