`deepTools <https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/>`_ is a suite of python tools particularly developed for
the efficient analysis of high-throughput sequencing data, such as ChIP-seq, RNA-seq or MNase-seq. It contains
tools for exploring and understanding the results of these experiments, such as plotting the coverage of reads
on genomic features, visualizing the genome browser tracks, calculating correlation between tracks, etc.
