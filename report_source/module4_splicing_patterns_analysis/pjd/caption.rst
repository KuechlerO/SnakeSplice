The Private Junction Detection is a simple tool developed by
`Oliver Kuechler <https://kuechlero.github.io/homepage/>`_ to detect
splicing junctions that only occur (or specifically do not occur) in a
single sample (or group of samples).
The tool is based on the `regtools <https://regtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ package.
