    <h3>Output Documentation</h3>

    <p>
        Overview over the results of the included splicing analysis tools, displaying the agreement
        between the different tools in regard to splice change or aberrant splice behaviour.
        <br>
        <b>Attention: </b>Only significant results, which are also listed in the reports of
        the individual files are listed here!
        <br>
        <b>Attention: </b>Also this list was generated by considering the assigned gene-names as merging features.
        Thus, results where no gene-name was linked to them might be missed in this report.
        Hence, additional scanning through the individual reports might be helpful!

            output files.</li>

            have detected a differential splicing behaviour in the given gene.
            This score includes the rMATS results.</li>

        <h5>Method:</h5>
        <p>
            The results of the individual tools are compared to each other.
            If the results of two tools are the same, the result is considered as "agreement".
            The agreement score is the sum of the tools, that have detected a differential splicing behaviour in the given gene.
            The ranking is the rank position of the result in the Tool's individual reports.
            <br><br>
            If you want to know more about the individual tools, please visit the individual report pages of this module
            and follow the reports' links to the tool's homepage.
