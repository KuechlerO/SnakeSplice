`Cufflinks <http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/>`_ assembles transcripts, estimates their abundances, and tests for differential expression and regulation in RNA-Seq samples.
It accepts aligned RNA-Seq reads and assembles the alignments into a parsimonious set of transcripts.
Cufflinks then estimates the relative abundances of these transcripts based on how many reads support each one, taking into account biases in library preparation protocols.
