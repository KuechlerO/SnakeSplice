`RSEM (RNA-Seq by Expectation-Maximization) <http://deweylab.github.io/RSEM/>`_ is a tool for the quantification of RNA-seq data.
The RSEM algorithm uses the expectation-maximization technique, it can operate with and without a reference, and reports transcripts per million mapped reads (TPM).
RSEM scales linearly with the amount of alignment quantity and uses the Bowtie tool for the read alignments.
