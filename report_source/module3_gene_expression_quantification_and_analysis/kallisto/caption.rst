`Kallisto <https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/>`_ is a tool to quantify RNA-seq data.
The kallisto algorithm uses a pseudo alignment approach to speed up the alignment procedure.
The "pseudo alignment" approach can quantify reads without making actual alignments.
Kallisto can handle paired-end and single-end reads.
It reports transcripts per million mapped reads (TPM).
